TODO (in order of priority)

These things will have to be done concurrently to some extent just to get a proof of concept type thing going:
	Finalize ideas for the spec

	Finish the specification

	Create a reference implementation
		Will probably be in c++ because muh OOP

Create environments for use with the network
	Most likely make a mod (or plugin, extension, etc) of firefox or such to work with the network
	
Create environments for running dynamic objects
	Mostly, adapt existing scripting languages to work with the network
	I'd like to see at least
		1. PHP
		2. Javascript
Spread the word
