	//Confirmation of receipt, if not received, resend.
	//Actually, I may remove this... It doesn't seem all that useful since a node

	//Gets object content, without getting the object if it is dynamic
	//Only retrieves content, not metadata; that is what get_object_metadata is for.

	//Confirmation of receipt, if not received, resend.

	//Might remove this too.  I'll have to review the message formats to make sure
	//there's no true need for it... this project is already getting larger than I
	//can easiy deal with and it's only me working on it.
