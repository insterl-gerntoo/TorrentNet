Node startup process:
	0. Load a list of known nodes:
		Send a ping request to each node
		The first one to respond is used to help establish ID
			Before using the node to establish ID, it should be
				used to determine if our node is behind NAT,
				and if so, how to traverse it.
				Of course, this generally only applies to nodes
					that aren't using IPv6
		If there are no nodes, or none respond, just randomly generate
		an ID and skip the rest of the steps.
	1. Get an ID:
		randomly generate a 128-bit ID, then connect to another node
		Send a check_id request
		If there is no node with our ID, then move on to the next step
		Else:
			Generate a random ID and fit it into the range of IDs
				of the server list returned:
				our_ID = (rand_id() % (max_ret_ID - min_ret_ID)) + min_ret_ID
	3. Get Nodes (optional)
		Send a get_nodes request to each node in the buckets, use returned nodes to
			get closer to ideal node IDs in the buckets.
		Repeat this as many times as is desired, but no more than 3 times is recommended

When a node receives a check_ID request from another node:
	If the node knows of other nodes with an ID closer than its own,
		it sends the request to those nodes, and echoes the responses
		it gets to the requesting node.
	Else:
		The node responds with its own ID.

Note, if a node makes contact with another node with the same ID, it must
	change its ID.  The node receiving contact keeps its ID.
