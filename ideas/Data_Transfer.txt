Torrenting
----------
The managing node, which keeps track of references to an object, could act as a tracker for a torrenting process on that object.
It should be able to tell a node which nodes are best able to distribute which parts of an object, and other useful stuff.
It is the responsibility of the nodes involved in the torrent to tell the tracking node what their status is.
