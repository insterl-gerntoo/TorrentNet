A note on endianness:
	Big-endian is the standard network byte order, so we'll use it for everything unless early performance tests
	on x86 machines show the overhead of endian swapping to be too much of an issue (unlikely). I refer to x86 machines 
	because the protocol will most likely be used primarily on servers, desktop PC's, and laptops, the vast majority of 
	which use x86-based CPU's.
	
	The UID's used by the protocol are to be treated as unsigned integers, even though most programming languages lack integer types
	beyond 64 bits in length.  Therefore, when going from x86 machine to internet, byte swapping is needed, and when going from internet
	to x86 machine, byte swapping is needed.  When on a machine using little-endian, algebraic operations on UID's (such as when generating
	the equally-spaced UID list, or comparing UID's using XOR) are to be done only AFTER the UIDs are in little-endian form.
	
	The same goes for any other data type including the message ID and IP data (addresses and portnums), for example CRC's need to be in little
	endian when they are being used for data verification on a little-endian machine, and need to be in big-endian when they are added to a
	message and sent out.  The only thing this doesn't apply to is raw data, like we'd have during file transfer.


//TODO: These really need to be redone to correspond with the actual limits of what UDP can handle...
//Actually... fukkit, I could have a completely separate mechanism controlling the sending of these messages,
//so I don't think I'll worry about the size.

Message format:
	First part, message type identifier, 2 bytes?
		Most Significant Bit should be 0 for request, 1 for response.
	Second part, message ID, 32-bit unsigned int, could be less.
		When a node sends a request, it generates this id, when a second node
			responds to this request, they send this id back in the response so the requesting
			node can tell which response maps to which request.
				For multiple responses to the same request, use the same id
		This can, and probably will be, just a random number.
	Third part, payload size, probably 32 bit unsigned integer.
	Fourth part, payload checksum, probably another 32-bit unsigned integer, maybe use CRC-32 like PNG does?
	Fifth part, the payload
