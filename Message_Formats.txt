Message format:
	First part, message type identifier, 1 byte, maybe?
		Most Significant Bit should be 0 for request, 1 for response.
	Second part, message ID, 32-bit unsigned int, could be less.
		When a node sends a request, it generates this id, when a second node
			responds to this request, they send this id back in the response so the requesting
			node can tell which response maps to which request.
		This can, and probably will be, just a random number.
	Third part, payload size, probably 32 or 64 bit unsigned integer.
	Fourth part, payload checksum, probably another 32-bit unsigned integer, maybe use CRC-32 like PNG does?
	Fifth part, the payload
	
"get_nodes":
	"get_nodes" request
		128-bit(?) requesting node's ID
	"get_nodes" response
		The message payload should contain:
			1-byte, number of nodes listed
			A list of Node data, for each node:
				128-bit(?) node ID
				1-byte connection details, ususally just IP version, IPv4 v. IPv6
				Two-bytes, portnum
				4 or 16 bytes, the IP for the node

"get_object_reference":
	"get_object_reference" request
		128-bit(?) object ID
	"get_object_reference" response
		1-byte "result status"
			0x01 for responding node knows which node(s) have the object
			0x00 for responding node does not know which nodes have the object
		1-byte node list size
		node list
			List of nodes that have the object if found
			List of nodes with IDs closest to that of the object if not found
