I'm not exactly sure what this does just yet.

freenet
-------
Does almost everything I want TorrentNet to do.
It doesn't seem to do dynamic web pages from distributed scripts natively, though,
	although it could probably be done through the program's plugin system.
That doesn't mean I feel like wading through all the program's source code to figure out how to do it,
	I honestly think it'd be easier to implement my own protocol.
	And it'd be more fun for me, even if freenet ultimately outdoes my protocol as more plugins roll in for it.
Also, I want to have a protocol on paper separate from the implementation, so that people could
	easily implement TorrentNet in any language they want, rather than having to translate source code.
